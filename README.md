# ml.project
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify sonar-detected objects as rocks or mines. Using sonar signal data, the model distinguishes between these objects to aid in underwater safety.  Key steps included data preprocessing, feature scaling, and selecting the best-performing algorithm.
